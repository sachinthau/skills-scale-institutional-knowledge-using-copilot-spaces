# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This collection provides a comprehensive guide to how OctoAcme delivers cross-functional projects, from initial concept through release and retrospective.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative approach to project delivery that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our methodology is designed to enable teams to deliver product features, services, and integrations efficiently while maintaining high quality standards and transparent communication with stakeholders.

At the core of our approach are five guiding principles: prioritizing customer value and usability, delivering small testable increments, ensuring clear ownership with named Project Managers and Product Leads, making data-informed decisions based on measured impact, and fostering psychological safety that encourages feedback and continuous learning.

## Core Workflows and Lifecycle

OctoAcme projects follow a structured lifecycle consisting of five key phases:

**Initiation** begins with validating and authorizing work through a Project One-pager that defines the problem statement, stakeholders, success metrics, and high-level timeline. This phase ensures business need is confirmed, stakeholders are aligned, and the project receives a go/no-go decision before moving forward.

**Planning** transforms approved initiatives into actionable plans by breaking work into shippable increments, creating prioritized backlogs with clear acceptance criteria, identifying dependencies and risks, and establishing release timelines and milestone maps. Teams use estimation techniques like T-shirt sizing or story points and define a clear Definition of Done.

**Execution and Tracking** involves day-to-day delivery with daily 15-minute standups focused on progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs for updates and risk flagging, and demos at sprint or milestone completion. Teams use project boards with standard workflows (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) and follow pull request conventions including small PRs, issue links, automated testing, and peer review.

**Release and Deployment** standardizes how features reach production through comprehensive pre-release checks including passing CI/security scans, drafted release notes, and documented rollback plans. Deployments follow a structured checklist covering staging verification, production deployment, post-deploy validation, and stakeholder announcements.

**Retrospective and Continuous Improvement** captures learnings after each sprint, release, or milestone through structured sessions that identify what went well, areas for improvement, and concrete action items with owners and timelines. This ensures continuous learning and iterative process improvements.

## Roles and Personas

OctoAcme projects involve clearly defined roles working collaboratively:

**Project Managers** coordinate delivery activities, manage schedules, risks, and communications, and enable teams to deliver on commitments efficiently. They create and maintain project plans, facilitate key meetings, ensure consistent documentation, and coordinate cross-team communication with a focus on delivering projects on time while maintaining transparency.

**Product Managers** define what should be built to deliver customer and business value, own the product vision, prioritize the backlog, and measure outcomes. They define problem statements and success metrics, make clear data-driven prioritization decisions, collaborate with stakeholders on trade-offs, and validate solutions through user research and metrics.

**Developers** design, build, test, and deliver software components while collaborating with product and project leads to implement features meeting acceptance criteria and quality standards. They write and maintain tests and documentation, participate in design and code reviews, assist in estimation, and help identify technical risks.

**QA/Testing** roles validate quality and acceptance criteria through comprehensive testing approaches, while **Stakeholders** provide critical inputs and approvals throughout the project lifecycle.

## Communication Strategies

OctoAcme maintains clear communication rhythms to ensure alignment and transparency:

- Weekly syncs between Project Managers and Product Managers for alignment on priorities and progress
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery teams (or as agreed) to maintain daily coordination
- Monthly stakeholder updates providing visibility into project status and upcoming milestones
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed, following defined escalation paths from team-level to PM to Product Lead to Sponsor

Communication follows structured templates for weekly status updates covering progress, next steps, risks/blockers, and decisions needed. Incident communication includes triage summaries, action plans, timelines, and scheduled blameless retrospectives.

## Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is embedded throughout OctoAcme's delivery process through multiple complementary practices:

**Testing Strategy** encompasses unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows before release, automated security scanning in CI pipelines, and manual QA for feature acceptance when needed.

**Code Quality** is maintained through pull request workflows requiring small, reviewable PRs (â‰¤400 lines when possible), issue links and acceptance criteria in PR descriptions, automated test and lint execution in CI, and at least one approval before merging.

**Risk Management** involves maintaining a Risk Register tracking ID, description, impact, likelihood, owner, mitigation plan, and status. Risks are identified during planning and execution, assessed for impact and likelihood, mitigated through actions and contingency plans, and monitored at weekly syncs.

**Metrics and Observability** track velocity and burndown, monitor success metrics from the Project One-pager, and use dashboards for key signals including errors, latency, and usage patterns.

## Key Artifacts

Projects maintain standard artifacts including:
- Project Charter/One-pager defining problem, goals, and success metrics
- Roadmap and Release Plan showing timelines and milestones
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog with prioritized work items
- Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done for quality gates
- Risk Register tracking and managing project risks
- Retrospective notes and action items for continuous improvement

## Getting Started

To apply these processes to your project:

1. Review the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) to understand the complete approach
2. Start with the [Project Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md) to create your Project One-pager
3. Keep your Project Charter updated in your project repository
4. Add process-specific documents to `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context
5. Reference role-specific guidance in [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) to shape team interactions
