# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- **Developers**: implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- **UX Designer**: creates user-centered designs, conducts research, ensures usability.
- **DevOps Engineer**: manages infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and operational reliability.
- **Data Analyst**: tracks metrics, analyzes impact, provides data-driven insights.
- **Customer Support Representative**: resolves customer issues, gathers feedback, surfaces insights.
- **QA/Testing**: validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- **Stakeholders**: provide inputs and approvals.

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
3. Execution: build, test, review, iterate.
4. Release: deploy, verify, announce.
5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Weekly design reviews (PdM + UX Designer + Developers)
- Weekly metrics review (PdM + Data Analyst)
- Weekly customer feedback review (PdM + Customer Support)
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed
